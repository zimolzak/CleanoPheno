# Inclusion Criteria

Anything in bold text below is a "fill in the blank" that can be
adjusted according to the needs of the user.

Record included if *all* the following criteria are identified:

1. Has an ER visit. Defined as: ER arrival time within a certain date
range. Dates for pilot data pull: tentatively **2023-01-01 to
2023-06-30**

2. Boarder in the ER. Defined as: anyone still physically in the ER
**6 hours** or more from the time of calling for admission or
transfer. (This includes calling for admission to general wards, or
step-down, or ICU: really admission to any hospital setting.)

3. Escalation (*any* of the following):

    a. Physically moves to ICU, *if* initial admission plan was
    step-down or general wards.

    b. Has a "change in status" or "change in bed type." Defined as: a
    transfer order from general wards to ICU (or from step-down to
    ICU).

    c. Crisis escalation

    d. Has a procedure in the OR

    e. Intubated, pressors, or code blue in ER. Defined as: certain
    charge codes for intubation, or charge code(s) for CPR, or an
    order in the ER for any pressor medications. (Codes TBD later.)




# Exclusion Criteria

Record excluded if *any* of the following criteria are identified on
date of ER arrival:

- Age less than 18 or age over **65** years

Record excluded if *any* of the following criteria are identified
within **one year** prior to ER arrival:

- Charlson Comorbidity Index greater than or equal to **2**, (using
  ICD-10 diagnosis codes for encounters)

- More than **3** hospitalizations

- Hospice




# Definitions

## Pressors

An order for any medication matching the following substrings:

- norepinephrine
- noradrenaline
- Levophed
- epinephrine
- adrenaline
- Adrenalin
- phenylephrine (*only* if given intravenously, *not* nasal, topical, or ophthalamic)
- Neo-Synephrine (IV only: same exclusion as above)
- dopamine
- Inotropin
- vasopressin
- Pitressin
- dobutamine
- Dobutrex
- milrinone
- Primacor

Including all of these may be "overkill." For example, I'm not sure
how often the inotropes for cardiogenic shock are really used in the
ER setting.




## Intubation

- 31500, insert emergency airway (intubation, endotracheal)
- 94002, vent mgmt initial day
- 94003, vent mgmt subsequent day
- 94656, initial ventilator mgmt
- 94657, continued ventilator mgmt

Probably no laryngoscopy (almost all operative).[^lary]

other vent management? 94660, 94662?




## Code blue (CPR)

- 92950, heart/lung resuscitation cpr

Others to include? Cardioversion is 92960. What about defibrillation?
No, because "Emergent cardioversion or defibrillation is not a
separately reportable service. Defibrillation is included in the
cardiopulmonary resuscitation service," according to AAPC.com. So how
about pacing?
