# Inclusion Criteria

Anything in bold text below is a "fill in the blank" that can be
adjusted according to the needs of the user.

Record included if *all* the following criteria are identified:

1. Has an ER visit. Defined as: ER arrival time within a certain date
range. Dates for pilot data pull: tentatively **2023-01-01 to
2023-06-30**

2. Boarder in the ER. Defined as: anyone still physically in the ER
**6 hours** or more from the time of calling for admission or
transfer to outside facility. (This includes calling for admission to general wards, or
step-down, or ICU: really admission to any hospital setting.)

3. Escalation (*any* of the following):

    a. Physically moves to ICU, *if* initial admission plan was
    step-down or general wards.

    b. Has a "change in status" or "change in bed type." Defined as: a
    transfer order from general wards to ICU (or from step-down to
    ICU).

    c. Crisis escalation in patient not initially identified as psych, 1:1 sitter or group supervision

    d. Has an unexpected procedure in the OR, IR suite or catheterization lab

    e. Intubated, pressors, or code blue in ER. Defined as: certain
    charge codes for intubation, or charge code(s) for CPR, or an
    order in the ER for any pressor medications. (Codes TBD later.)

    f. Unanticipated death in the Emergency Center




# Exclusion Criteria

Record excluded if *any* of the following criteria are identified on
date of ER arrival:

- Age less than 18 or age over **65** years

Record excluded if *any* of the following criteria are identified
within **one year** prior to ER arrival:

- Charlson Comorbidity Index greater than or equal to **2**, (using
  ICD-10 diagnosis codes for encounters)

- More than **3** hospitalizations

- Hospice




# Definitions

## Pressors

An order for any medication matching the following substrings:

- norepinephrine
- noradrenaline
- Levophed
- epinephrine
- adrenaline
- Adrenalin
- phenylephrine (*only* if given intravenously, *not* nasal, topical, or ophthalamic)
- Neo-Synephrine (IV only: same exclusion as above)
- dopamine
- Inotropin
- vasopressin
- Pitressin
- dobutamine
- Dobutrex
- milrinone
- Primacor

Including all of these may be "overkill." For example, I'm not sure
how often the inotropes for cardiogenic shock are really used in the
ER setting.




## Intubation (CPT)

- 31500, insert emergency airway (intubation, endotracheal)
- 94002, vent mgmt initial day
- 94003, vent mgmt subsequent day
- 94656, initial ventilator mgmt
- 94657, continued ventilator mgmt





## Code blue (CPR)

- 92950, heart/lung resuscitation cpr, CPT code for procedure
- I46.9 – (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code for "Cardiac arrest, cause unspecified")
- I46.2
- I46.8 (note that in these 3 cases, the first character is the letter "I")

Insertion of Central line (CPT)
- 36556 - non-tunneled
- 36558 - tunneled (we place these for dialysis)

Insertion of arterial line (CPT)
- 36620

Cardioversion (CPT)
- 92960






# Notes

The following codes were deemed to be *not* relevant for this e-trigger.

Laryngoscopy (not relevant because almost all are operative).[^lary]

[^lary]: aapc.com/codes/coding-newsletters/my-otolaryngology-coding-alert/ throat-keep-this-laryngoscopy-primer-on-hand-for-distinguishing-three-types-135090-article

"Other vent management" CPT codes not relevant (94660, 94662).

What about defibrillation?
No, because "Emergent cardioversion or defibrillation is not a
separately reportable service. Defibrillation is included in the
cardiopulmonary resuscitation service," according to AAPC.com. So how
about pacing?

*pacing would be hard to add as it’s only counted if actual wire inserted – so transcutaneous doesn’t count and rarely float pacemakers in the EC at this point
