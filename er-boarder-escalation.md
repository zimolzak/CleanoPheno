    1:1 sitter or group supervision

    d. Has an unexpected procedure in the OR, IR suite or catheterization lab

    e. Intubated, pressors, or code blue in ER. Defined as: certain
    charge codes for intubation, or charge code(s) for CPR, or an
    order in the ER for any pressor medications. (Codes TBD later.)

    f. Unanticipated death in the Emergency Center

- Inotropin
- vasopressin
- Pitressin
- dobutamine
- Dobutrex
- milrinone
- Primacor




## Intubation (CPT)

- 31500, insert emergency airway (intubation, endotracheal)
- 94002, vent mgmt initial day
- 94003, vent mgmt subsequent day
- 94656, initial ventilator mgmt
- 94657, continued ventilator mgmt




## Code blue, CPR, and other critical condition codes

- 92950, heart/lung resuscitation CPR (CPT)
- I46.9, cardiac arrest, cause unspecified (ICD-10)
- I46.2, cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac condition (ICD-10)
- I46.8, cardiac arrest, cause unspecified (ICD-10)
- 36556, insertion of central line, non-tunneled (CPT)
- 36558, insertion of central line, tunneled (CPT)
- 36620, insertion of arterial line (CPT)
- 92960, cardioversion (CPT)

letter "I".)




# Notes

The following codes were deemed to be *not* relevant for this
e-trigger. We retain them here to explain our rationale.

- Laryngoscopy: not relevant because almost all are operative.[^lary]

- "Other vent management" CPT codes not relevant (94660, 94662).

- Defibrillation not relevant because "Emergent cardioversion or
defibrillation is not a separately reportable service. Defibrillation
is included in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation service," according
to AAPC.com.

- Pacing: would be hard to add as it's only counted if actual wire
inserted. So transcutaneous doesn't count, and rarely float pacemakers
in the EC at this point.
