1. Include wording ”OR TRANSFER”. So calling for admission OR TRANSFER.

2. Change wordidng to “(general wards, or stepdown OR MICU, any hosp setting)”. Would have to change (3a) as well, “physically moves to icu *if* plan was SDU or Ward.

3. Fix typo Ddefined

4. Define (3e) as: certain Charge code for intubate, or Charge code for CPR, or order for any pressor meds.

5. Note that (3b) Rapids aren’t generally called in ER. May be challenging... but you would see something [SB will discuss with Dr. Guy] like pts with a “change in status”--usually meaning a transfer order from MedSurg to ICU or similar.
