% ER Revisit with Critical Indicators
% 2024-01-04
% Andrew Zimolzak, MD, MMSc

# Criteria

Must have all of the following:

1. Discharged from Emergency Department to home (exclude discharge from
ED to skilled nursing facility), and then

2. return to ED, and

3. is admitted to ICU, Operating Room, or admission with surgical or another
procedure,

4. within **X days** of first ED visit




# Modifications

- Include any readmission, regardless of timeframe, but within **5 days**.[^question]
- Exclude elective returns.
- Include patients with malignancies.
- ICU readmission within **3 days**
- OR/Procedure within **7 days**

- Exclude patients with the presence of any of the following diagnoses
  at the time of the initial ED visit. Diagnoses can be in problem
  list or prior inpatient/outpatient encounter diagnosis codes. The
  intent is to target "conditions that result in expectant waiting,"
  or conditions that are expected to recur. See definitions below.

    - Cholelithiasis
    - Biliary colic
    - Renal colic
    - LVAD patients

- Consider age in future/ build option

[^question]: What does "regardless of timeframe" mean? Also, how can
"within 5 days" work, when later there are different time intervals
specified for ICU and OR (3 or 7 days)?




# Definitions

## Cholelithiasis

I assume we will *not* put cholecystitis in this definition. In other
words, don't exclude acute cholecystitis, because standard of care is
admission and surgery or percutaneous drainage.

- K80.20 Calculus of gallbladder without cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.21 Calculus of gallbladder without cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.50 Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.51 Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.70 Calculus of gallbladder and bile duct without cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.71 Calculus of gallbladder and bile duct without cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.80 Other cholelithiasis without obstruction
- K80.81 Other cholelithiasis with obstruction




## Biliary colic

This should be covered already by the codes above, in particular K80.2*.




## Renal colic

- N20.0 Calculus of kidney
- N20.1 Calculus of ureter
- N20.2 Calculus of kidney with calculus of ureter
- N20.9 Urinary calculus, unspecified
- N21.0 Calculus in bladder
- N21.1 Calculus in urethra
- N21.8 Other lower urinary tract calculus
- N21.9 Calculus of lower urinary tract, unspecified
- N22 Calculus of urinary tract in diseases classified elsewhere
- N23 Unspecified renal colic




## LVAD

- Z45.09 Encounter for adjustment and management of other cardiac device
- Z95.811 Presence of heart assist device




# Do not exclude

- anything under K80.* that mentions
    - with acute cholecystitis (K80.0*)
    - with chronic cholecystitis  (K80.1*)
    - with acute and chronic cholecystitis  (K80.1*)
    - with cholangitis (K80.3*) acute and/or chronic
    - with cholecystitis unspecified (K80.4*)
    - with acute and/or chronic cholecystitis (K80.6*)
- never use R10.83 "colic," because that is specific to pediatrics only.
