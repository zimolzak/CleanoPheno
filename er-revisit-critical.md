# Definitions

## Cholelithiasis

I assume we will *not* put cholecystitis in this definition. In other
words, don't exclude acute chole, because standard of care is
admission and surgery or percutaneous drainage.

- K80.20 Calculus of gallbladder without cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.21 Calculus of gallbladder without cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.50 Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.51 Calculus of bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.70 Calculus of gallbladder and bile duct without cholecystitis, without obstruction
- K80.71 Calculus of gallbladder and bile duct without cholecystitis, with obstruction
- K80.80 Other cholelithiasis without obstruction
- K80.81 Other cholelithiasis with obstruction




## Biliary colic

This should be covered already by the codes above, in particulary K80.2*.




## Renal colic

- N20.0 Calculus of kidney
- N20.1 Calculus of ureter
- N20.2 Calculus of kidney with calculus of ureter
- N20.9 Urinary calculus, unspecified
- N21.0 Calculus in bladder
- N21.1 Calculus in urethra
- N21.8 Other lower urinary tract calculus
- N21.9 Calculus of lower urinary tract, unspecified
- N22 Calculus of urinary tract in diseases classified elsewhere
- N23 Unspecified renal colic




## LVAD

- Z45.09 Encounter for adjustment and management of other cardiac device
- Z95.811 Presence of heart assist device



# Do not exclude

- anything under K80.* that mentions
    - with acute cholecystitis (K80.0*)
    - with chronic cholecystitis  (K80.1*)
    - with acute and chronic cholecystitis  (K80.1*)
    - with cholangitis (K80.3*) acute and/or chronic
    - with cholecystitis unspecified (K80.4*)
    - with acute and/or chronic cholecystitis (K80.6*)
- never use R10.83 "colic," because that is specific to pediatrics only.
